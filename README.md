Hi! Thanks for visiting my project. So far, I have created a MySQL database of all of Taylor Swift's songs. The database has tables for albums, songs, and lyrics. I have also built a few APIs to pull random songs from the database. 

My goals:
- Create a public app where users can ask for help with an issue or feeling and the app will suggest the best Taylor Swift song to listen to, or gives advice as if it were Taylor Swift. The idea is to demonstrate building a full-stack app.

I'd like to use technologies that I learned about duriung my undergrad as well as some technologies I've been introduced to at work.

I'm using:
- HTML, CSS and JS
- MySQL
 
Some tools I'm using:
- SQL Workbench
- VS Code
- Github
- Insomnia
- Swagger
